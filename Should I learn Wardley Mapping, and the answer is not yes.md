# Should I learn Wardley Mapping?
# The answer is not "Yes!".
```
If you have arrived here, you must have heard about Wardley Mapping and you wonder whether you should put any effort to learn it.

(pause: 0.3)

I can help you answer that question based on my experience, and I have been teaching people how to map since 2014.

(pause: 0.3)

Wardley Mapping vibes *'better strategy'* all around, and it indirectly promises people getting what they want.

However, it is not your fairy godmother. There are caveats. 
```md
# Caveats
```

(narration-mode: fragment)


The first and the most imporant is that good strategy has to be built on solid foundations, and those solid foundations involve
```md
# Caveats
* foundations
```

having emotional resilience. By Emotional Resilience, I mean the ability to limit replacing observations with feelings. It is impossible to build a working, fear or ambition based-strategy as it will be detached from reality.
```md
# Caveats
* foundations
	* healthy emotions 
```

The second requirement is actually having the power to change things, which includes leadership. Without leadership skills, you will build only an arm-chair strategy. That will be a fun exercise (it always is), but will not change your situation at all.

(pause: 0.5)


```md
# Caveats
* foundations
	* healthy emotions
	* leadership
```

If you know that your foundations are solid, and you know that emotions do not cloud your judgement and that you can act on your decisions, then you ready to look at the big question, which is:

```md
# Do the results of my actions 
# surprise me?
```

Do the results of my actions *surprise* me? Usually in a bad way?

(pause: 1)

If yes, then it is likely because you did not have time to properly identify check your assumptions. And it is not your fault.

```md
# Slow communication 
# -> 
# Only few things discussed
```

Telling stories takes time and effort, on both sides.

Teller must choose the right story.

Listener must put effort to understand the story together with all the implications.

When we are busy, we take shortcuts. 

We do not discuss all the stories, we do not have enough of time to think through stories told by others.

```md
# We rely on assumptions!
```

As a result, we rely on assumptions, and that lowers the quality of our decisions.

```md
# Communication speed
```

Practicioners reported that Wardley Mapping helps them replace **weeks** of analyst work with a **one** meeting.

But don'tbe fooled - increasing your communication speed does not mean you will have more time for anything else.

Quite contrary.

This is the effect that you should expect. 

The better you are at communicaiton, the more will you do it.

(pause: 2)

Better understanding of the situation comes from your and your team ability to share and challenge assumptions. 

Mapping is just a vehicle that may help achieve that.

So, should you learn Wardley Mapping?
```md
# Should you learn Wardley Mapping?
```
Yes, but only if you have foundations sorted  *and* you *believe* you could benefit from other-than stories communications means, particularly if you frequently suffer from your assumptions turning out to be wrong.

My rule-of-thumb is that if I hear:

(pause: 1)

We do not really know

```md
# We do not really know
```
(pause: 1)

usually followed by

(pause: 1)

---

```md
# We do not really know,
# we have to guess!
```

so we have to guess

(pause: 1)

then time spent on mapping will not be lost. 

(pause: 1)

It will certainly help you put more structure on things you already know and be more conscious about your assumptions. 

(pause: 1)

So...

What did you hope to get out of Wardley Mapping?

Do you think more comfortable with your decision to learn it? (or not)?

Please do let me know!
